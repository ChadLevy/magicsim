# magicsim
Shadow priest tailored tool for simming stat weights in a fight-aware manner using SimulationCraft. Please note that although this tool is specifically designed by and for shadow priests, the methodology is extensible to other classes and depends on the quality of your class/specialization's simc profiles. The methodology used for this tool was borrowed from the How2Priest.com community.

How to run sims and analyze: "node run.js `<region>` `<realm>` `<name>`"

How to analyze (say if you have run sims and want to adjust weights): "analyze.js"

Note: You must have 7zip installed and in your PATH (see StackOverflow/Google for more information) for this tool to properly work. If you do not have 7zip in your PATH, you will most likely see the error "undefined" when running run.js.

Special thanks to Djriff, Anshlun, N1gh7h4wk, Publik, the simc developers, and the general H2P community.
