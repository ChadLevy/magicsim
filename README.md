# magicsim
Shadow priest tailored tool for simming stat weights in a fight-aware manner using SimulationCraft. Please note that although this tool is specifically designed by and for shadow priests, the methodology is extensible to other classes and depends on the quality of your class/specialization's simc profiles. The methodology used for this tool was borrowed from the How2Priest.com community.

**This script only runs on Windows**

*Big disclaimer that follows all simulated stat weights: Please take me with a grain of salt. Trust and verify. These are made with the same methodology as the sims that H2P runs for pinned resources, but it doesn't make these results infallible. Use common sense and your brain with this tool.*

**Another disclaimer: Use your brain, verify against pinned information. This tool is only an assistant that does a very specific task. It only gives you what it thinks is the best stat weights for your current gear/talent setup assuming a synthesized "average" tomb raid.**

Special thanks to Djriff, Anshlun, N1gh7h4wk, Publik, the simc developers, and the general H2P community.
